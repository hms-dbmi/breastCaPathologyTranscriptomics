# Integrative Multiomics-Histopathology Analysis for Breast Cancer Classification

The Estrogen Receptor (ER) Status, Progesterone Receptor (PR) Status, HER2 Receptor Status are trained by Caffe version 1.0. Caffe is developed by Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)/The Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and community contributors and released under the [BSD 2-Clause license](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/LICENSE). The training model and final state can be found in their corresponding folders ER (Estrogen Receptor Model), PR (Progesterone Receptor Model), and HER2 (HER2 Receptor Status).

The Tumor vs. Normal, Histological Subtype, PAM50, and TP53 Mutation Status model are trained by Keras version 2.4.0. Due to the file size limit of github these models can be provided upon request. However, for the Tumor vs. Normal and Histological Subtype models, the code used to create HDF5 files to store data, to train and finetune models can be found in the tumornorm_subtype folder.
